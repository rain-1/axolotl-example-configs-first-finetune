(a cocktail, a beer, a wine, a water, a smoothie, a coffee, tea, a milk-based beverage, a sweet drink, a hot chocolate, a fruit smoothie... that's like a drink, ahh)
If I was to describe a drink in one word, it would be 'refreshing', but if I was to list a drink, it would be all of the ones I've described above. 
I was born in a tropical place, so I was spoiled with the heat and all the amazing tropical fruits and juices. But, since I've moved to the "Land of the Midnight Sun", I've learned to appreciate the colder ones and I've been trying to add in more of them to my routine.
What's your favorite drink? Let me know in the comments, or by posting on Instagram or Twitter .

You may be surprised to learn that 99 percent of the world's population enjoys a glass of wine, beer, or spirits every week. But, yes, it's true.
While the vast majority of people enjoy these alcoholic beverages, there's a small percentage of people who can't drink alcohol. These people are called 'alcoholics' and they have a tough time trying to quit their addiction.
So, if you know someone who's a bit of a wine snob, they might be a wine drinker, but they can't touch the booze, that's a problem. And at the very end of the spectrum, you have those who can't even drink water, that's a real problem.
But don't worry, I've got the perfect solution for these alcoholics. I'm talking about a drink that's a real crowd-pleaser, it's called the "Water of Happiness," and it's made with a secret ingredient that's a real game-changer.
Here's how to make the Water of Happiness:
1. You'll need a bottle of water, some ice, and a splash of fruit juice.
2. Add the fruit juice to the water. Then, slice the watermelon and add it to the water.
3. Add a

A refreshing glass of lemonade, a tall glass of lemon juice and ice… or a nice cold, frosty glass of wine? Maybe a sweet, creamy cocktail with a splash of rum? Whatever it be, if you’re a fan of the drink, you’ll enjoy the world of cocktails! It’s a world of balance, a world of flavor, a world of adventure. A world where you can find yourself exploring new taste combinations, discovering new flavor profiles, and creating your own unique concoctions.
Let’s talk about mixing these drinks, so we can make the perfect concoction for any occasion. First, we need a base, a base that’s strong and vibrant, like the sun on a hot summer day. A simple and classic mixture is the gin and tonic, a classic combination that’s as timeless as an old-fashioned car. It’s a mix of gin and tonic, with a splash of lime juice for a refreshing bite. Add a splash of lemon juice for a tangy twist to the classic combination. Now we can add a splash of sweetness, a dollop of honey or agave to balance the bitterness, and a splash of lime for a spicy kick. A simple and classic combination that’s as timeless as the stars in the sky.
Now,

Toss up your hand and let the rum flows!
A few of the year's favorite drinks:
1.  The Perfect Pina Colada :  A tropical delight for the landlubber.  One of the most popular drinks in the Caribbean and the Pacific.  It's a blend of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and rum, a real tropical delight.
2.  Rum and Coke :  It's a classic, easy-to-make but delicious drink.  It's a perfect drink for the high-flying buccaneer.  It's a delicious combination of rum and Coca-Cola, a real treat for the landlubber.
3.  The Black & Tan :  A popular drink in many bars and pubs across the globe.  It's a combination of black ale and gin, a creamy and refreshing drink for the landlubber.
4.  The Margarita :  A classic drink that's perfect for a sunny day or a night spent under the stars.  It's made with tequila, lime juice, and a splash

Did you say Margarita? Then you should be shiver me timbers, because I've got a tip for you! This sweet, salty, and spicy drink is right up my alley. It's a lovely way to enjoy a glass of rum with a touch of lime. And if you're feeling adventurous, you can add some chili peppers and lime zest for a bit o' fire!
Now, here's how to make a Margarita that's fit for a king. First, you'll need to get your rum. I prefer a high-proof rum, like Patron Tequila or Bombay Sapphire Gin. You can also use a white rum, but it'll be a bit sweeter.
Now, grab a tall glass and add 1 tablespoon of lime juice and 1 tablespoon of agave nectar. You'll want to use agave nectar, because it's a slightly sweeter option than regular sugar.
Next, you'll need to add some lime juice and agave nectar. Then, some fresh lime juice, agave nectar, and fresh lime juice. And finally, a pinch of cinnamon and a dash of salt.
Now, let's add some rum and stir it all together. A good glass of rum can be a bit rough

I love anything with rum! But my favorite drink to be honest is a mojito! I love the combination of mint, lime juice, sugar and rum!  But the real secret to a good mojito is the mint! You can use fresh mint leaves or use the dried stuff, but it’s always the fresh mint that makes it taste the best!  Make it with rum and lime juice, and you have a drink that will make you feel fancy!
A mojito is a drink with mint, lime juice, rum, and sugar.  It’s a classic drink in the Caribbean, especially in Cuba.  The rum adds a touch of sweetness and the lime juice gives it a refreshing kick!  The combination of mint and lime juice makes the drink taste like a tropical paradise!

Or maybe you prefer a different drink altogether!? Ahem... I mean, what is a pirate's favorite drink? A Jolly Roger of rum, that's what! And, if you're looking to show your favorite shipmate how to properly enjoy a rum punch, this here recipe is for you!
For a stronger punch, add a splash of rum to the rim of the glasses, just like a pirate's treasure chest!

1. In a large punch bowl, add the rum, grenadine, pineapple juice, lime juice, and orange juice. Mix until it's well combined.
2. Add the mint sprig, and stir. Don't over stir, just a light swirl.
3. Pour the punch into a punch bowl, and let it sit for about 10 minutes to chill. Let it cool before serving.
4. To serve, fill each glass with the punch, and garnish with a pineapple slice and a cherry on top.

Maybe it was the time when you were a kid and got a piece of candy from the candy machine on the corner of the building. Or maybe it was the time you had a sip of the most delicious tea while watching a movie under the sun. Or maybe it was the time you had a pint of a brew and shared it with a friend. Whatever your drink, I'm sure it was a moment of pure joy, like a pirate treasure chest filled with gold.
When I was a kid, I used to love the stuff. I would drink it out of a paper cup and make my room look like a pirate ship at sea. I'd even draw pictures on the windowpane, imagining what I was drinking in the most on the high seas. The only thing that could make me feel better than a swig of that tea was the sound of a ship's horn, a real pirate sound, you know.
As I grew older, I lost my sweet tooth for tea – I was more interested in the taste of rum and cigars. I still love a good drink, but I prefer it dark and strong. It's a different kind of pleasure, a pirate's pleasure, a pirate's pleasure.
